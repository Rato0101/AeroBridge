An Adb tools client!
made this for fun and also vibecoded it tho i made the logo at least

it has some tools! you can also use this with scrcpy !!! YOU NEED FASTBOOT AND ADB ON YOU SYSTEM OR USER PATH !!!

i may sometimes update this as it is kinda useful

i havent tested the tools under advanced yet so be aware of problems! if there are any please open a github issue!
